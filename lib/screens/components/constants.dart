Internet Access: CalPal utilizes an internet connection to retrieve the latest calorie data and securely store users' encrypted calorie information in the cloud. This enables convenient synchronization of calorie logs across multiple devices, ensuring seamless access and data consistency.

Camera Access: The app requires access to your device's camera to capture and identify food items. This feature assists in accurate calorie tracking and nutritional analysis by visually recognizing and cataloging consumed meals.
